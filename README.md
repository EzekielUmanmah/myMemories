> Overview

  While I knew of the parts of creating an app with CRUD operations, this project taught me how to build an app from scratch to deploying it on a live website.
  Additionally, I learned about user authentication with JWT and Google OAuth, state management with Redux Toolkit, and using a Material UI to build a fully responsive site right out of the box.
